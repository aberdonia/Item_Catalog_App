# Item_Catalog_App
For Udacity Project

Initalise the google login capability:
1) Add your own API_KEY to the login.html file in the 'templates' directory.
2) Add your client secrets file to root directory as 'client_secrets.json'.

Begin by launching your vagrant virtual machine.
Running the 'project.py' file in python to initialise the database.
Once server is running, stop it using "CTRL + C" (or alternative).
Now run 'adddb.py' in python to populate the database with a few examples.
Run 'project.py' to launch app.
Open http://localhost:8000/ to use app.

Use login and logout to access some features in the app.
'Sell' to add new items to app.
Once an item has been added, you can edit or delete it if you're the owner. If not then you cannot. Try it.

Use http://localhost:8000/JSON to access JSON data through API GET request.

Thanks
